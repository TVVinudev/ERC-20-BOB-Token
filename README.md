# ERC-20-BOB-Token

This repository contains the smart contract for BOB Token (BOB), an ERC20 token deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract allows for minting tokens and includes an admin role for minting control. It is verified and published on Etherscan.

The ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Comments 20), was proposed by Fabian Vogelsteller in November 2015. This token standard implements an API for tokens within smart contracts.

ERC-20 token standard defines a set of rules that enables easy interaction in the network. The token standard is applicable to all ERC-20 tokens and it includes common rules like what is the total supply of token, how the tokens are transferred, etc. The ERC-20 standard contains 6 key functions that must be implemented to meet the standard.

If a smart contract implements the following methods and events it can be called an ERC-20 token contract and, once deployed, it will be responsible to keep track of the created tokens on Ethereum.
